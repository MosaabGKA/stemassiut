                    entrepreneurial leadership, high ethical standards, and civic engagement

                    critical thinking, and a pioneering spirit to support the new Egyptian vision

                    Education takes on a broad meaning at Assiut STEM High school. As a
                    Boarding school, we recognize that we have an explicit mission not only to
                    educate students in the classroom, but also help them become well-rounded
                    individuals. In our boarding school, we bring a kind of family feel to
                    education and make school more of an intimate place. Within the dorms,
                    students develop their own life skills and natural abilities. They are to make
                    choices that matter, balance their time and develop their social skills by
                    frequent interactions with their peers. With such circumstances, the school
                    creates a strong network of students, faculty, and staff and a feeling of
                    warmth and welcoming within the community.
